# Voltapp

This project is an attempt to build a prototype mobile app to allow patients to track and record their state of health following heart surgery with Volta.

Two pages are build:

* The first one  is a form to fill daily state of health.
  For now, the form's data are pretty simple. There is a date fill automatically, a general mood for the date and some questions about well-being related to cardiac arrhythmia . I choose to represent the mood with emoji since an image is worth a thousand words.  
 

* The second page is a report composed of a simple snapshot of the daily recorded ECG (currently a random generated one), the current day's form filled, warning or wishes based on the state indicated.
I choose a report for the second page to keep track of the state. Thus, after each day  one would be able to have a snapshot memory of the day and be able to send it to a physician. The ECG  displayed will be plot based on the data send by the rhythmic Holter or connected watch use by the patient. Therefore a daily real-time ECG report could be presented.

## Build with
* React 
* React-Bootstrap
* Github
* VS Code


## Installation et Scripts

In the project directory after cloning the repository, you should run:

### `npm install`
Install all the dependencies of project 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


## Improvements
* Complete form questions after  collaboration with expert cardiologists and others end users
* Link with popular medical web/desktop app like DoctoLib for distant consultation for instance
* The backend part of the application can use real-time database and authentication of Firebase to store the data generated by the connected watched.
* A notification service could be implemented to manage sending the report and contacting physician when critical events is happening.
